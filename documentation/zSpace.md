Zaha Hadid Architects Computation and Design Group, ZHACODE Research Team, explores novel spatial and experiential affordances of new technologies in structure, fabrication-aware geometry, robotic fabrication, and industrialized construction. The team incorporates these advances into workflows at ZHA to address pressing issues of participatory and sustainable development of the built environment. 

ZHACODE investigates design domain problems where computation can supplement human intuition, to improve speed, to assimilate data, and to discover novel possibilities. Research is incrementally accrued through systemic development and pilot testing in fundamental topics or trajectories of focus. These are refined over time and methods mature toward increasingly constrained commercial project applications. The resulting bespoke computation framework continues to accrue collaborative and field-tested research in topics ranging from computer graphics to robotic construction technologies. These tools, methods and workflows inherit the mathematical, physical and material history and employ them in a contemporary setting as a continuum. Current research ranges across Computer Graphics, Geometry Processing, Fabrication Technologies, Data Driven Design, Game Technologies, Package Delivery and Supply Chain Integration.
